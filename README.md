# Heart Disease Analysis ❤️  
Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a heart disease dataset**
to understand patterns, relationships, and key factors associated with heart disease.

The objective is to use **data visualization techniques** to gain insights into how variables such as
**age, gender, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate** are related to heart disease occurrence.

This project was completed as part of the **GeeksforGeeks Machine Learning & Data Science Program**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is influenced by multiple health and lifestyle factors.
Understanding relationships between these factors helps in:
- Identifying risk patterns
- Supporting early diagnosis
- Improving data-driven healthcare insights  

This project explores the dataset visually to uncover meaningful trends.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis & Visualizations Performed
The following visualizations were created to analyze the dataset:

- **DistPlot** – Age distribution of patients  
- **Pie Charts** – Gender distribution among heart disease cases  
- **Violin Plots** – Gender vs heart disease comparison  
- **Heatmap** – Correlation between numerical features  
- **PairPlot** – Pairwise feature relationships  
- **JointPlot** – Relationship between cholesterol and maximum heart rate  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Majority of heart disease cases fall between **ages 40 and 70**
- **Male patients (~79%)** are more affected than females (~21%)
- Strong correlations observed between:
  - Age
  - Cholesterol
  - Maximum heart rate
- Visual analysis helps quickly identify important trends and relationships
